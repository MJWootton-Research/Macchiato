## Dependencies
* [Python 3](https://www.python.org) (untested on older versions of Python)

## Installation
Clonning the respoitory via [Git](https://git-scm.com) is the recommended method for installing Macchiato. Check to see if you have Git installed and the current version by opening a command-line terminal and running:
```
git --version
```
If no Git installation is found, consult [this page](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) for further instructions. Furthermore, it is recommended to [create a SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) and [add it to one’s GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) to eliminate the need for password entry during push & push requests.

The following command will create a local instance of the repository in the current working directory:
```
git clone git@github.com:MJWootton-Resilience-Projects/Macchiato.git
```

## Usage
Consult [`Macchiato.pdf`](Macchiato.pdf). *Further documentation pending...*
